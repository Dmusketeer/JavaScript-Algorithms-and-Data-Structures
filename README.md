Introduction
------------

This project is a collection of algorithms and data structures implemented in JavaScript. The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive set of algorithms and data structures that can be used in a variety of applications, including web development, game development, and scientific computing.

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with this project, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. Once you have these installed, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies by running the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/Dmusketeer/JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures.git
cd javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures
npm install
```

Algorithms
----------

The following algorithms are included in this project:

* Sorting algorithms: bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort.
* Searching algorithms: linear search, binary search, and hash table search.
* Graph algorithms: breadth-first search, depth-first search, and Dijkstra's algorithm.
* String algorithms: Rabin-Karp algorithm, Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm, and Boyer-Moore algorithm.
* Dynamic programming: longest common subsequence, shortest path, and knapsack problem.

Data Structures
--------------

The following data structures are included in this project:

* Arrays: dynamic arrays, static arrays, and sparse arrays.
* Linked lists: singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.
* Stacks: arrays, linked lists, and dynamic arrays.
* Queues: arrays, linked lists, and dynamic arrays.
* Trees: binary trees, AVL trees, and B-trees.
* Graphs: adjacency matrices, adjacency lists, and edge lists.
