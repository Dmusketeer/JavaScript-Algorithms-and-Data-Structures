# Algorithm
## What is an Algorithm?

An `algorithm` is a `sequence of instructions` that a computer must perform to solve a well-defined problem. It essentially defines what the computer needs to do and how to do it. Algorithms can instruct a computer how to perform a calculation, process data, or make a decision.

## How do algorithms work?
Algorithms use a set of initial data or input, process it through a series of logical steps or rules, and produce the output (i.e., the outcome, decision, or result).


### Example of algorithm 
Letâ€™s consider for example an algorithm that calculates the square of a given number.

* `Input:` the input data is a single-digit number (e.g., 5).

* `Transformation/processing:` the algorithm takes the input (number 5) and performs the specific operation (i.e., multiplies the number by itself).

* `Output:` the result of the calculation is the square of the input number, which, in this case, would be 25 (since 5 * 5 = 25).

We could express this as an algorithm in the following way:

`Algorithm:` Calculate the square of a number

1. Start
2. Input the number (N) whose square you want to find.
3. Multiply the number (N) by itself.

4. Store the result of the multiplication in a variable (result).

5. Output the value of the `variable` (result), which represents the square of the input number.
6. End.

An algorithm represents the thinking process for solving a problem in an abstract yet precise way, rather than the answer itself.

There are different types of algorithms, such as:

1. `Sorting algorithms:` These algorithms are used to sort data in ascending or descending order. Examples include Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Quick Sort.
2. `Searching algorithms:` These algorithms are used to find specific data within a collection of data. Examples include Linear Search and Binary Search.
3. `Graph algorithms:` These algorithms are used to perform operations on graphs, such as finding the shortest path between two nodes, or determining whether a graph is connected. Examples include Dijkstra's algorithm and Bellman-Ford algorithm.
4. `Cryptography algorithms:` These algorithms are used to encrypt and decrypt data. Examples include AES and RSA.
5. `Machine learning algorithms:` These algorithms are used to analyze and learn from data, and make predictions or decisions based on that data. Examples include Linear Regression and Decision Trees.

Algorithms can be classified based on their complexity, stability, and other factors. They can also be optimized for performance, memory usage, and other criteria.
