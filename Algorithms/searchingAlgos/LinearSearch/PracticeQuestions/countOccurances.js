// **Problem Statement - Count Occurrences:**

// You are given an array of integers, and your task is to write a function that counts how many times a specific element appears in the array.
// The element you are searching for will be provided as an input parameter.

// **Input:**

// - An array of integers (`arr`) with a length `n` (1 <= n <= 1000).
// - An integer (`target`) representing the element you want to count.

// **Output:**

// - An integer representing the count of how many times the `target` element appears in the array.

// **Function Signature:**

// ```js
// function countOccurrences(arr, target) -> int
// ```

// **Example:**

// ```js
// arr = [1, 3, 4, 3, 6, 3, 5]
// target = 3
// count = countOccurrences(arr, target)
// # Output: count = 3
// ```

// **Explanation:**

// In the given example, the array `arr` contains the element `3` three times. Therefore, the function returns `3` as the count of occurrences of the `target` element.

// **Constraints:**

// - The elements in the array (`arr`) are integers within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
// - The count of occurrences is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

// You should write a function that efficiently counts the occurrences of the `target` element in the array and returns the count as the output.

function countOccurrences(arr, target) {}
