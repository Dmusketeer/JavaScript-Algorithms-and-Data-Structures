A stack is a fundamental data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It allows you to store and retrieve elements in a specific order, making it useful for tasks like managing function calls, tracking state changes, and solving various algorithmic problems. Here are details on the stack data structure and its operations using JavaScript:

**Stack Data Structure**:

- A stack is a linear data structure that consists of a collection of elements, with two primary operations: push and pop.

- Elements are added or removed from the top of the stack, which is referred to as the "top" of the stack.

- Stacks are used to maintain a specific order for elements, and the last element added is the first one to be removed.

**Common Stack Operations**:

1. **Creating a Stack**:

   To create a stack in JavaScript, you can use an array. Initialize an empty array to represent the stack.

   ```javascript
   const stack = [];
   ```

2. **Pushing (Adding) an Element**:

   Use the `push()` method to add an element to the top of the stack. This operation has a time complexity of O(1).

   ```javascript
   stack.push(5); // Adding 5 to the top of the stack
   stack.push(10); // Adding 10 to the top of the stack
   ```

3. **Popping (Removing) an Element**:

   Use the `pop()` method to remove and return the element from the top of the stack. This operation also has a time complexity of O(1).

   ```javascript
   const topElement = stack.pop(); // Removing and returning the top element (10)
   ```

4. **Peek (Accessing the Top Element)**:

   To access the element at the top of the stack without removing it, you can use array indexing. This operation has a time complexity of O(1).

   ```javascript
   const topElement = stack[stack.length - 1]; // Accessing the top element without removing it
   ```

5. **Checking if the Stack is Empty**:

   You can check if the stack is empty by examining its length or using a conditional statement. Checking for emptiness has a time complexity of O(1).

   ```javascript
   const isEmpty = stack.length === 0; // Checking if the stack is empty
   ```

**Stack Use Cases**:

- Stacks are commonly used for tasks such as implementing function call stacks in recursion, parsing expressions, tracking state changes in algorithms, and maintaining the history of navigation in web browsers.

**Example: Using a Stack to Check Balanced Parentheses**:

Here's a simple example of using a stack to check if a string of parentheses is balanced (i.e., every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis):

```javascript
function isBalancedParentheses(expression) {
  const stack = [];
  for (let char of expression) {
    if (char === '(') {
      stack.push('(');
    } else if (char === ')' && stack.pop() !== '(') {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return stack.length === 0;
}

const expression1 = "(a + b) * (c - d)"; // Balanced parentheses
const expression2 = "((a + b) * (c - d)"; // Unbalanced parentheses
console.log(isBalancedParentheses(expression1)); // true
console.log(isBalancedParentheses(expression2)); // false
```

Stacks are a fundamental data structure in computer science and have various practical applications. They are versatile and commonly used for solving problems that require a specific order of operations.
